    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this class is to cover a subset of advanced machine learning techniques, after students have seen the basics of data mining (such as in IDS 572) and machine learning (such as in IDS 575). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, we will cover topics spanning deep learning and reinforcement learning. In particular, we will study popular deep learning architectures, their design choices and how they are trained. This will be motivated by business applications dealing with image, text and tabular data. Finally, we will look at online and reinforcement learning frameworks and their role in sequential decision making settings such as retail.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tentative list of topics is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Backpropagation and feed forward neural networks\n",
    " - Convolutional networks (CNNs)\n",
    " - Recurrent networks and Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs)\n",
    " - Attention mechanism and transformers (BERT, GPT-3)\n",
    " - Variational autoencoders (VAEs)\n",
    " - Generative adversarial networks (GANs)\n",
    " - Deep reinforcement learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\n",
    " - Deep learning design choices such as optimizers (Adam, RMSprop), nonlinearities, embeddings, attention, dropout, batch normalization etc."

    " #### Special Accommodations\n",
    "\n",
    "UIC has the [Disability Resource Center (DRC)](https://drc.uic.edu/) to help students needing special accommodations. If you have any condition, such as a physical or learning disability, which will make it difficult for you to carry out the work as outlined in the syllabus or which will require academic accommodations, you can go to the DRC for assistance, and should do so at the beginning of the semester or as early as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a student needs remote learning accommodation due to a physical condition, such as if they are immuno-compromised and especially vulnerable to Covid, then the student can submit a formal request for remote learning accommodation through the DRC. This is needed in order to maintain fairness and consistency in our attendance policy."
