    "\n",
    "Instead of embedding words, we will embed movies.  In particular, if we can embed movies, then similar movies will be close to each other and can be recommended.  This line of reasoning  is analogous to the [distributional hypothesis of word meanings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics). For words, this roughly translates to words that appear in similar sentences should have similar vector representations. For movies, vectors for two movies should be similar if they are watched by similar people. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let the total number of movies be $M$. Let $X_{i,j}$ be the number of users that liked both movies $i$ and $j$. We want to obtain vectors $v_1,...,v_i,...,v_j,...,v_M$ for all movies such that we minimize the cost $c(v_1,...,v_M) = \\sum_{i=1}^{M}\\sum_{j=1}^{M}\\mathbf{1}_{[i\\neq j]}(v_i^Tv_j - X_{i,j})^2$. Here $\\mathbf{1}_{[i\\neq j]}$ is a function that is $0$ when $i=j$ and $1$ otherwise.\n",
